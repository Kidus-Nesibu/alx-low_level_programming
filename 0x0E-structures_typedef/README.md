# C Structures and Typedef

In C programming, structures and typedef are essential features that enhance code organization and readability. This repository provides examples and explanations for utilizing structures and typedef in your C programs.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/c-structures-typedef.git

Usage
Structures
Structures allow you to group different types of variables under a single name. They are particularly useful when representing complex entities with multiple attributes. Here's a basic example:
#include <stdio.h>

// Define a structure to represent a point in 2D space
struct Point {
    int x;
    int y;
};

int main() {
    // Declare a variable of type 'struct Point'
    struct Point p1;

    // Access and modify the members of the structure
    p1.x = 10;
    p1.y = 20;

    // Print the values of the structure members
    printf("Coordinates of p1: (%d, %d)\n", p1.x, p1.y);

    return 0;
}
Typedef
Typedef allows you to create an alias for an existing data type, making your code more readable and maintainable. It's commonly used with structures to avoid repeating the struct keyword every time you declare a variable of that type. Here's how you can use typedef with the above example:
#include <stdio.h>

// Define a structure to represent a point in 2D space
typedef struct {
    int x;
    int y;
} Point;

int main() {
    // Declare a variable of type 'Point'
    Point p1;

    // Access and modify the members of the structure
    p1.x = 10;
    p1.y = 20;

    // Print the values of the structure members
    printf("Coordinates of p1: (%d, %d)\n", p1.x, p1.y);

    return 0;
}
