   - Implementing and using functions in C.
   - Understanding the significance of function prototypes.

2. **Nested Loops:**
   - Mastering the art of nested loops to solve complex problems.
   - Enhancing your logical thinking and problem-solving abilities.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into multiple tasks, each designed to address specific aspects of functions and nested loops. The structure is intuitive, ensuring a progressive learning experience.

- **Task 0:**
  - Description: Write a function that prints a specified number of times.
  - Objective: Practice basic function creation and usage.

- **Task 1:**
  - Description: Write a function that prints numbers from 0 to 9, separated by commas.
  - Objective: Reinforce understanding of loops and function integration.

- **Task 2:**
  - Description: Write a function that checks for uppercase characters.
  - Objective: Introduce conditional statements within functions.

- **Task 3:**
  - Description: Write a function that multiplies two integers.
  - Objective: Apply arithmetic operations within functions.

- **Task 4:**
  - Description: Write a function that prints the numbers from 0 to 98, excluding 2 and 4.
  - Objective: Enhance knowledge of loop control and exclusion.
