# C - More Pointers, Arrays, and Strings

This repository contains my solutions and explanations for the exercises in the "C - More Pointers, Arrays, and Strings" project.

## Description

In this project, I delve deeper into the concepts of pointers, arrays, and strings in the C programming language. Each exercise focuses on honing my skills in manipulating these fundamental data types efficiently.

## Project Structure

- **0-reset_to_98.c**: This program takes a pointer to an integer as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.

- **1-swap.c**: This program swaps the values of two integers.

- **2-strlen.c**: This program returns the length of a string.

- **3-puts.c**: This program prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.

- **4-print_rev.c**: This program prints a string in reverse.

- **5-rev_string.c**: This program reverses a string.

- **6-puts2.c**: This program prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character.

- **7-puts_half.c**: This program prints the second half of a string.

- **8-print_array.c**: This program prints n elements of an array of integers.

- **9-strcpy.c**: This function copies the string pointed to by `src`, including the terminating null byte (`'\0'`), to the buffer pointed to by `dest`.

- **100-atoi.c**: This function converts a string to an integer.

- **101-keygen.c**: This program generates random valid passwords for the "101-crackme" executable.

## Usage

To compile any of the C programs, use a C compiler such as gcc:
```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89 <filename.c> -o <output_filename>
