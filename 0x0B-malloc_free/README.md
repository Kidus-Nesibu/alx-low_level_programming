# Dynamic Memory Allocation in C using malloc and free

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my humble README on dynamic memory allocation in C using `malloc` and `free`. In this repository, you'll find a simple C program demonstrating how to dynamically allocate memory for an array using `malloc` and then free up that memory using `free`.

## How to Use

First things first, let's clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dynamic-memory-allocation-c.git
cd dynamic-memory-allocation-c
gcc -o dynamic_allocation dynamic_allocation.c
./dynamic_allocation
