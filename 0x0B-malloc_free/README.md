# Dynamic Memory Allocation in C using malloc and free

Hey there! üëã Welcome to my humble README on dynamic memory allocation in C using `malloc` and `free`. In this repository, you'll find a simple C program demonstrating how to dynamically allocate memory for an array using `malloc` and then free up that memory using `free`.

## How to Use

First things first, let's clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dynamic-memory-allocation-c.git
```

Once you've got the code on your machine, navigate into the directory:

```bash
cd dynamic-memory-allocation-c
```

Now, it's time to compile the program. We'll use GCC for this:

```bash
gcc -o dynamic_allocation dynamic_allocation.c
```

Great! Now, let's run the program:

```bash
./dynamic_allocation
```

You should see the program output, which demonstrates dynamic memory allocation and deallocation in action. Feel free to dive into the code (`dynamic_allocation.c`) to understand what's happening under the hood.

## What's Inside?

- `dynamic_allocation.c`: This is the main C file where all the magic happens. Here, we dynamically allocate memory for an array, populate it with some data, and then free up the memory once we're done.
- `README.md`: You're reading it right now! This file provides instructions on how to use the program.
