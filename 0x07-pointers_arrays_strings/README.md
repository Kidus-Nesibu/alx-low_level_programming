# Project: 0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings

## Overview
Hey there! Welcome to my latest C project, titled "Even more pointers, arrays, and strings". This project is all about diving deeper into the world of pointers, arrays, and strings in the C programming language. By working through this project, I aim to solidify my understanding of these fundamental concepts and improve my C programming skills.

## Project Structure
Let me walk you through the structure of this project:

### 1. Source Code
Inside the `src` directory, you'll find all the C source code files for this project. Each file is carefully named to reflect its purpose or the specific concept it covers.

git clone <repository_url>

### 2. Headers
The `include` directory contains any header files used in the project. These headers might include function prototypes, macros, or other declarations necessary for the source code files to work seamlessly together.

cd even-more-pointers-arrays-stringsi

### 3. Documentation
Clear documentation is key to understanding and maintaining code. That's why I've included a `docs` directory, where you can find additional documentation related to the project. This documentation might include explanations of design decisions, usage instructions, or insights into complex algorithms or functions.

make
	
### 4. Build Scripts
At the root of the project, you'll find any build scripts or makefiles needed to compile the project. These scripts are designed to simplify the build process by automating compilation and linking tasks.

./main
