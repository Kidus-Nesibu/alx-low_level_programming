# Project Title: 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while

## Description
This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering curriculum and focuses on fundamental concepts in C programming. The main topics covered include variables, `if` statements, `else` statements, and `while` loops. These are essential building blocks for understanding control flow and data manipulation in C.

## Topics Covered
- **Variables**: Introduction to declaring and using variables to store and manipulate data.
- **if Statements**: Understanding conditional statements for decision-making in code execution.
- **else Statements**: Extending conditional logic with alternative execution paths.
- **while Loops**: Implementing loops for repetitive execution of code based on a specified condition.

## Files
- `0-positive_or_negative.c`: Program to print whether a randomly generated number is positive, negative, or zero.
- `1-last_digit.c`: Program to print the last digit of a randomly generated number and determine its relationship to 5.
- `2-print_alphabet.c`: Program to print the alphabet in lowercase using a `while` loop.
- `3-print_alphabets.c`: Program to print the alphabet in lowercase and then in uppercase using `while` loops.
- `4-print_alphabt.c`: Program to print the alphabet in lowercase, excluding the letters 'q' and 'e'.
- `5-print_numbers.c`: Program to print single-digit numbers using a `while` loop.
- `6-print_numberz.c`: Program to print single-digit numbers using only `putchar`.
- `7-print_tebahpla.c`: Program to print the alphabet in reverse order.
- `8-print_base16.c`: Program to print all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase.
- `9-print_comb.c`: Program to print all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.
- `10-print_comb2.c`: Program to print all possible combinations of two-digit numbers.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile the C files using a C compiler (e.g., `gcc`).
4. Run the compiled executables to observe the output.
