# Singly Linked List Implementation in C

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my implementation of a singly linked list in C. In this project, I've provided a basic algorithm and code snippets for creating and manipulating singly linked lists.

## Introduction

A singly linked list is a fundamental data structure consisting of a sequence of elements where each element points to the next one in the sequence. This structure allows for efficient insertion and deletion operations, making it a versatile tool in programming.

## Algorithm Overview

Here's a brief overview of the algorithm used in this implementation:

1. **Define the Node Structure**: A structure is defined to represent each node in the linked list. Each node contains the data and a pointer to the next node.

2. **Initialize the Head Pointer**: A pointer to the first node in the linked list, often called the head pointer, is initialized. Initially, it's set to NULL to indicate an empty list.

3. **Implement Operations**:
   - **Insertion**: Nodes can be inserted at the beginning or end of the list.
   - **Deletion**: Nodes can be deleted from the beginning or end of the list.
   - **Traversal**: The list can be traversed to access or process each node's data.

4. **Memory Management**: Proper memory allocation and deallocation are ensured to avoid memory leaks.

## Code Snippets

Here are some code snippets demonstrating the basic operations:

```c
// Function to insert a node at the beginning of the list
void insertAtBeginning(int value) {
    // Allocate memory for the new node
    struct Node* newNode = (struct Node*)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    // Set data and next pointer
    newNode->data = value;
    newNode->next = head;
    head = newNode;
}
// Function to traverse the list and print each element
void traverse() {
    struct Node* temp = head;
    while (temp != NULL) {
        printf("%d -> ", temp->data);
        temp = temp->next;
    }
    printf("NULL\n");
}
